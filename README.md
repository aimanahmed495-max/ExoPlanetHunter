# 🌌 Exoplanet Detection with Machine Learning

This project was developed for **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025** under the exoplanet discovery challenge. It uses a machine learning model to detect potential exoplanets from stellar light curve data (Kepler/TESS).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Place **all files in a single folder**.  
3. Open the main Python file or notebook.  
4. Run all cells or execute the script to see model predictions and visualizations.

## 🧠 Features
- Light curve data preprocessing  
- Machine learning classification of exoplanet candidates  
- Visualization of detected transits  
- Built with Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib

## 📊 Results
Achieved high accuracy (~90%) in identifying potential exoplanet transits.

## 🛰️ Credits
Created for **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**.
